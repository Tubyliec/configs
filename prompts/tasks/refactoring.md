# Refactoring

Analyze the project code for code smells, architectural issues, and potential performance bottlenecks.

## Creation

For creating a new project and components, follow the [Project Creation Guide](creation.md)

## Project Overhaul

- Perform refactoring step by step - first move existing files by folders and update imports

## Expected output

- List the identified problems and code smells (both code-level and architectural)
- Explain why these issues are problematic in the context of the given stack
- Propose:
  - code-level improvements
  - architectural and modularity recommendations
  - if necessary, an improved folder structure
- For each significant change, describe:
  - the original problem
  - the essence of the change
  - the expected impact (readability / maintainability / performance)
