## Code Style & Design Guidelines

- Aim for clear, readable, and maintainable code
- Prefer straightforward and explicit solutions
- Reduce duplication where it meaningfully improves clarity (DRY)
- Keep implementations simple and focused (KISS)
- Avoid adding abstractions or features unless they provide clear value (YAGNI)
- Apply SOLID principles pragmatically, considering the context and constraints of the chosen stack
- Avoid unnecessary complexity, patterns, or indirection without measurable benefits
- Minimize redundant computations, state updates, re-renders, and object recreations where applicable
- Consider the overall project structure, including modularity and separation of concerns
